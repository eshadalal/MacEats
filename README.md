Uni struggles are real, but finding food on campus doesn’t have to be! Craving something? Search it up and find out where it’s at in no time! More features coming soon, so stay tuned! 

to do: 

- documentation
- let users rate items and add to favorites
- an app for campus menus each day so we don’t have to go from place to place to see if they’re serving something we like or not
- fix search bar position
- fix tags placement and style
- remove duplicates
- make tags looks like tags not text (color code: meal type, location)
-
