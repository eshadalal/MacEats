# MacEats

to do: 

- documentation
- let users rate items and add to favorites
- an app for campus menus each day so we don’t have to go from place to place to see if they’re serving something we like or not
- fix search bar position
- fix tags placement and style
- remove duplicates
- make tags looks like tags not text (color code: meal type, location)
-
